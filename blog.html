        <h2>My Blog</h2>
        <p>I share what I've learned while improving my web development skills.</p>

        <h3>How I Built My NFT Preview Card</h3>
        <p>This project comes from The Frontend Mentor. It was a good website to hone your HTML and CSS skills. I learned flexbox works. Though, I'm a way more far but I learned a lot on this project.</p>

        <h3>My first Landing Page</h3>
        <p>This project also comes from The Frontend Mentor. I learned so much flexbox in here. My favorite part is I layout each element on their respective area. This project triggers me to learn JavaScript. I told to myself once I finished even Landing Page, I am ready to learn JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>How I Built Rock Paper Scissor Game</h3>
        <p>This project is my first project that I used programming language (JavaScript). At first, it was so hard because it is new to me. I mean to HTML+CSS then HTML+CSS+JS. I have learned a lot on this project. If's statement, Functions, and basic loop.</p>

        <h3>How I Built Etch-A-Sketch</h3>
        <p>My 2nd project with programming language (JavaScript). I would say this project is hard for me because on The Odin Project, whereas I studying web development, this project does not tackle so much so I need to do some research but I have fun to do this project though it is not like a real sketchbook but still I manage to finished it.</p>

        <h3>How I Built Calculator</h3>
        <p>My 3rd project. A project that takes my limit. I did hours to debug what is going on?! It did not work the way it works. But I learned in this project that a nested Functions, event Listener. I finished this projects around three months because I have been busy on my work. I don't have time to hold this but gladly I finished it.</p>
